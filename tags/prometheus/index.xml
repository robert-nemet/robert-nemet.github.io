      <description>This is the third part of a series about designing metrics for event-driven systems. You can check the first part and the second part of this series before proceeding.
While I discussed the general principles of designing metrics in the first part, I explained Prometheus metric types. I applied them as the RED method in the second part. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the USE method with Prometheus. Finally, a short discussion about the Four Golden Signals and a conclusion about all the methods.</description>

      <description>This is the second part of a series about designing metrics for event-driven systems. You can check the first part of this series.
Prometheus is open source system for monitoring and alerting. It is a part of CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and it is one of the most popular monitoring systems. You can say it is a de facto standard for monitoring in Kubernetes.
To design metrics with Prometheus, you need to understand its metric types.</description>
