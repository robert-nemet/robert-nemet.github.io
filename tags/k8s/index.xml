      <title>Deploying Database Changes For Microservices</title>

      <description>When a service works with a database its core is tied with the database schema. Usually, that means that service models are represented in the database. Usually as tables, but not necessary.
Anyway, from that comes a requirement to update database schema when the core of service is changed. If you version your service then you should version your database schema as well. For this purpose, the Liquibase is a good tool(or at least one that I like).</description>

      <description>..is the smallest deployable unit one can create and manage inside Kubernetes(K8s). A Pod can have one or more running containers, so it is a set of running containers.
What is a container? A container image is a binary containing an application you created and all that needs for its running like system and application libraries, configuration files, etc. When you run a container image it becomes container. You can imagine a container image as a software-package but when you run it becomes container.</description>
