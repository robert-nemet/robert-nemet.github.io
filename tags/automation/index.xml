      <description>Motivation If you are a developer, you know how much time you spend on pull request reviews. We all try to write the best code we can. When we are done, we ask our team members to review our code. Sometimes, making a pull request is more complex than it sounds. Over time, teams learn that pull requests need to be standardized to speed things up and improve communication. That is why we have a pull request template, for example.</description>

      <title>Task vs Make - Final Thoughts</title>

      <description>So, after spending time moving from Make to Task, I decided. I&amp;rsquo;m going with Task in my future projects. Make will not be removed from my projects immediately, but I will not use it in the future. Let me tell you why.
All this is my personal opinion. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that Task is better than Make. I think that Task is better for me.
Global Taskfile I have a global Task in my home directory for standard stuff.</description>

      <title>WIP: Taskfile instead of Makefile?</title>

      <description>Recently, I stumbled upon a tool called Taskfile. It is a task runner, similar to Makefile, but with many improvements. I decided to try it and see if it can replace my Makefiles.
Why Taskfile? First of all, Makefile is a good tool. Today, you can use it on any platform, not just Linux. It is a standard tool for running tasks. It is flexible and powerful. My relation with it is love/hate.</description>

      <title>How to schedule task with crontab</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m keeping notes in simple text files. Imho, this is a straightforward solution that I can control. I need to be able to version my changes and to keep backup as well. For that, I&amp;rsquo;m using git. But I have to make commits and push changes periodically. I&amp;rsquo;m delegating this simple, dull, and repetitive toil to the crontab.
Crontab ..is a file used by cron. It is a time-based job scheduler available in Unix-like OS.</description>
