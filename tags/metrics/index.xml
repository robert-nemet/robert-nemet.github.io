      <description>This is the second part of a series about designing metrics for event-driven systems. You can check the first part of this series.
Prometheus is open source system for monitoring and alerting. It is a part of CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and it is one of the most popular monitoring systems. You can say it is a de facto standard for monitoring in Kubernetes.
To design metrics with Prometheus, you need to understand its metric types.</description>

      <description>Event-driven systems at the moment are dominating when it comes to software system design. Some of the characteristics of event-driven systems are asynchronous actions and eventual consistency.
In traditional systems, each call will produce an immediate response. While in event-driven systems(EDS) the response is not immediate but it is made when the system is ready to process a call. The EDS is not easy to debug or predict the next state.</description>
