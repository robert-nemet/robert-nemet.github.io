      <description>I live and work in one of the Balkan countries, Belgrade, Serbia. After the sad &amp;rsquo;90s, all countries in the region try to catch up with the rest of the world. That led to a boom in IT. A large portion of IT is outsourcing companies. Some companies are domestic, and some are foreign. Also, some companies opened their R&amp;amp;D centers in the region. Small and big as well. There was and still is a large number of startups.</description>
