      <title>WIP: Taskfile instead of Makefile?</title>

      <description>Recently, I stumbled upon a tool called Taskfile. It is a task runner, similar to Makefile, but with many improvements. I decided to try it and see if it can replace my Makefiles.
Why Taskfile? First of all, Makefile is a good tool. Today, you can use it on any platform, not just Linux. It is a standard tool for running tasks. It is flexible and powerful. My relation with it is love/hate.</description>

      <title>Learning eBPF: Maps, Ring Buffers and Output</title>

      <description>I set the stage for learning eBPF. As mentioned in the previous post, eBPF is a technology that allows us to run code in the kernel. This is a compelling technology, but it comes with a few limitations. One of them is that we can&amp;rsquo;t use the standard output to print messages. At least not directly. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how we can do this.
Why can&amp;rsquo;t I use the standard input/output? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this picture The eBPF programs are executed in the kernel.</description>

      <description>For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following stuff around eBPF, and it is very promising. What I just wrote is an understatement. At first glance, eBPF is bringing many new possibilities to our toolbox. You can start with performance profiling, tracing, security, networking, etc. But let&amp;rsquo;s start from the beginning.
By the way, I&amp;rsquo;m doing this on OSX. For eBPF, you need Linux kernel 4.1 or newer. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll be running some VMs.</description>
