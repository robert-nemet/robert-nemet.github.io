      <description>Working with containers is a necessity today for developers. You will likely need to work with some kind of storage or interact with some external service, like Solr or Postgres.
You can install the required service on your local machine, which comes with the burden of choosing the correct installation, configuration, etc&amp;hellip; Nothing too complicated but takes time.
Docker and Containers In short, the container is an isolated process on the host machine.</description>

      <description>..is the smallest deployable unit one can create and manage inside Kubernetes(K8s). A Pod can have one or more running containers, so it is a set of running containers.
What is a container? A container image is a binary containing an application you created and all that needs for its running like system and application libraries, configuration files, etc. When you run a container image it becomes container. You can imagine a container image as a software-package but when you run it becomes container.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m keeping notes in simple text files. Imho, this is a straightforward solution that I can control. I need to be able to version my changes and to keep backup as well. For that, I&amp;rsquo;m using git. But I have to make commits and push changes periodically. I&amp;rsquo;m delegating this simple, dull, and repetitive toil to the crontab.
Crontab ..is a file used by cron. It is a time-based job scheduler available in Unix-like OS.</description>

      <description>A simple problem:
 Rename files with extension xyz which names ends with file. They need to start with document- and have extension txt For example if a file is 1-file.xyz it should be renamed to document-1.txt
 From this:
&amp;gt; ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 12 owner staff 384 Jan 1 19:26 . drwxr-xr-x 7 owner staff 224 Oct 23 11:32 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 owner staff 0 Jan 1 19:26 1-file.</description>
