      <title>Kubernetes: Containers, Pods and Deployments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the second part of the series about Kubernetes. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rnemet.dev/practical_k8s/k8s_intro&#34;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;,
we introduced the K8s and its basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start creating services or scaling apps, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand
the core components of Kubernetes. This post walks you through pods, containers,
and deploymentsâ€”what they are, how they work, and how they come together to keep
your apps running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-setup&#34;&gt;Local Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To taste K8s, you do not need access to some fancy remote platform. You can test
and play with it on your own machine. Right now, there are a lot of solutions that
can help you run K8s locally:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes: A Gentle Introduction for Developers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diving into the world of Kubernetes doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be intimidating. This post
will explain Kubernetes, why it matters, and how it fits into the modern
application landscape. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand its core purpose and how it
can make your development life more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audience for this post is developers who are new to Kubernetes or those
who work on a product that uses Kubernetes but do not have a deep understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Practical k8s: Pods</title>
      <link>https://rnemet.dev/posts/practical_k8s/pods/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Pod would be the smallest deployable unit one can create and manage inside Kubernetes(K8s). In practice, rarely you create a Pod directly.
Instead, one would create a Deployment, a StatefulSet, a DaemonSet, a Job, or a CronJob. These are higher-level constructs that would create
Pods for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;m covering common tasks that one would do with a Pod in daily work, like getting logs, opening a shell inside a container, debugging a Pod, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes: Exposing Services and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</title>
      <link>https://rnemet.dev/posts/practical_k8s/k8s_intro_svc_hpa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the third part of the series about Kubernetes for beginners. In the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rnemet.dev/practical_k8s/k8s_intro_pt2&#34;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced the K8s and its basic
components. In the second part, I discussed containers, pods, and deployments.
This post will discuss services(SVC) and horizontal pod autoscaler(HPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short post, I will discuss how to expose your services to the outside world
and scale your applications based on the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exposing-deployments-services&#34;&gt;Exposing Deployments: Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a Deployment, you&amp;rsquo;ll get Pods running your app. So, start local K8s
cluster and deploy an app:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
