      <title>Kubernetes: Containers, Pods and Deployments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the second part of the series about Kubernetes. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rnemet.dev/practical_k8s/k8s_intro&#34;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;,
we introduced the K8s and its basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start creating services or scaling apps, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand
the core components of Kubernetes. This post walks you through pods, containers,
and deploymentsâ€”what they are, how they work, and how they come together to keep
your apps running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-setup&#34;&gt;Local Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To taste K8s, you do not need access to some fancy remote platform. You can test
and play with it on your own machine. Right now, there are a lot of solutions that
can help you run K8s locally:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes: A Gentle Introduction for Developers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diving into the world of Kubernetes doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be intimidating. This post
will explain Kubernetes, why it matters, and how it fits into the modern
application landscape. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand its core purpose and how it
can make your development life more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-kubernetes-and-why-should-you-care&#34;&gt;What is Kubernetes and Why Should You Care?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes. The name alone sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel. And in some
ways, it is. It&amp;rsquo;s a system designed to orchestrate fleets of containers across vast,
distributed landscapes. But at its core, Kubernetes is here to solve a real human
problem: running applications reliably without losing your mind. So they say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Practical k8s: Pods</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Pod would be the smallest deployable unit one can create and manage inside Kubernetes(K8s). In practice, rarely you create a Pod directly.
Instead, one would create a Deployment, a StatefulSet, a DaemonSet, a Job, or a CronJob. These are higher-level constructs that would create
Pods for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;m covering common tasks that one would do with a Pod in daily work, like getting logs, opening a shell inside a container, debugging a Pod, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
