      <title>Deploying Database Changes For Microservices</title>
      <link>https://rnemet.dev/posts/k8s/deploy-liquibase/</link>

      <description>When a service works with a database its core is tied with the database schema. Usually, that means that service models are represented in the database. Usually as tables, but not necessary.
Anyway, from that comes a requirement to update database schema when the core of service is changed. If you version your service then you should version your database schema as well. For this purpose, the Liquibase is a good tool(or at least one that I like).</description>

      <title>Docker-Compose: How To Rebuild Working Application</title>
      <link>https://rnemet.dev/posts/docker/compose-rebuild/</link>

      <description>While developing application and using docker-compose one question quickly arise:
How to properly rebuild application?
Once an image is built new one will not be built with the same tag as long it exists in a local cache. The compose builds an image it names it with the pattern &amp;lt;context&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;service_name&amp;gt;:latest.
Where:
Context is directory name where compose YAML is Service is service name in compose YAML file This means that you can stop or takedown the compose application, next time you run it your images will not be rebuilt if they already exist.</description>

      <description>If you are developing microservices, docker-compose(compose), can be a very powerful tool. Think of a case with an API service and database. Creating and maintaining a database with the use of the Liquibase.
Initial plan &amp;hellip;would be:
start DB run the Liquibase to make changes start an app Adding docker-compose as a driver to utilize this process:
sequenceDiagram autonumber Docker --&gt;&gt; PostgresDB: start PostgresDB --&gt;&gt; PostgresDB: wait to finish start PostgresDB --&gt;&gt; Docker: done Docker --&gt;&gt; LiquibasePG: start LiquibasePGDB --&gt;&gt; PostgresDB: execute changeLog LiquibasePGDB --&gt;&gt; Docker: done Docker --&gt;&gt; Echo: start PostgresDB Setup This is the simplest step.</description>

      <description>Working with containers is a necessity today for developers. You will likely need to work with some kind of storage or interact with some external service, like Solr or Postgres.
You can install the required service on your local machine, which comes with the burden of choosing the correct installation, configuration, etc&amp;hellip; Nothing too complicated but takes time.
Docker and Containers In short, the container is an isolated process on the host machine.</description>

      <description>..is the smallest deployable unit one can create and manage inside Kubernetes(K8s). A Pod can have one or more running containers, so it is a set of running containers.
What is a container? A container image is a binary containing an application you created and all that needs for its running like system and application libraries, configuration files, etc. When you run a container image it becomes container. You can imagine a container image as a software-package but when you run it becomes container.</description>

      <title>How to schedule task with crontab</title>
      <link>https://rnemet.dev/posts/schedule_tasks/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m keeping notes in simple text files. Imho, this is a straightforward solution that I can control. I need to be able to version my changes and to keep backup as well. For that, I&amp;rsquo;m using git. But I have to make commits and push changes periodically. I&amp;rsquo;m delegating this simple, dull, and repetitive toil to the crontab.
Crontab ..is a file used by cron. It is a time-based job scheduler available in Unix-like OS.</description>

      <title>How to rename multiple files</title>

      <description>A simple problem:
Rename files with extension xyz which names ends with file. They need to start with document- and have extension txt For example if a file is 1-file.xyz it should be renamed to document-1.txt
From this:
&amp;gt; ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 12 owner staff 384 Jan 1 19:26 . drwxr-xr-x 7 owner staff 224 Oct 23 11:32 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 owner staff 0 Jan 1 19:26 1-file.xyz -rw-r--r-- 1 owner staff 0 Jan 1 19:26 10-file.</description>
