      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m keeping notes in simple text files. Imho, this is a straightforward solution that I can control. I need to be able to version my changes and to keep backup as well. For that, I&amp;rsquo;m using git. But I have to make commits and push changes periodically. I&amp;rsquo;m delegating this simple, dull, and repetitive toil to the crontab.
Crontab ..is a file used by cron. It is a time-based job scheduler available in Unix-like OS.</description>

      <description>A simple problem:
 Rename files with extension xyz which names ends with file. They need to start with document- and have extension txt For example if a file is 1-file.xyz it should be renamed to document-1.txt
 From this:
&amp;gt; ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 12 owner staff 384 Jan 1 19:26 . drwxr-xr-x 7 owner staff 224 Oct 23 11:32 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 owner staff 0 Jan 1 19:26 1-file.</description>
